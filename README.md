# Project Cat

## Intro
Hello everyone! This is one of my first projects, at least the first solo project that I will putting up on GitHub as a Public repo from the start.

## Description
The project itself is a text-based RPG that will be written in Python. The difference will be that this version will be using AI for determining the path, rather than having it be hardcoded.

## Inspiration
I have always wanted to write a text-based RPG, and have written some before in Java and C++. However those projects were very arduous because all the paths were hard coded, and some paths did not even have proper endings due to the sheer number of divergences. I recently got the idea to use AI as an engine to generate the paths because of my Capstone project, in which we created a chatbot web application that uses AI installed locally on a machine. Thus I wanted to try my hand in using the same idea but with a different approach.

## Dedication
I am dedicating this project to my younger brother, he is one of the best things to have ever happened to me. I hope that he gets to play and enjoy this game one day. He also really likes cats.
